# Ant vs. the Bugs

This is a simple version of the classic "Frogger" arcade game that I adapted in order to hone my object-oriented programming skills. (My first version of Frogger was called "FrogXING" and I played it on a Macintosh Performa 600...!)

## Getting Started

A live version of this app is available here: https://n00b1209.github.io/arcade-game/

Alternatively, you can follow the instructions and play it on your local machine:

### Installing

Clone the repository on GitHub or copy the following code into git:

```
git clone https://github.com/n00b1209/arcade-game.git
```

Open the file

```
index.html
```
in the browser of your choice. The game should start running right away!

### How to play

Move the player with the arrow keys. The goal is to reach the water without running into any "bugs" (because I get it, developers don't like bugs...).

## Future Versions
The current version fulfills the minimum requirements for this project (I hope). I'm doing this course while also running a household and wrangling two little kids so the following features are something I hope to implement in the future:
* Timer function
* Keeping track of number of deaths and completed games
* Difficulty presets that influence number and speed of enemies
* Different player and enemy sprites for the user to choose from
* Collectible goodies for bonus points
* ...
